# educational-webpage
This is an individual assignment project requiring students to use a fairy tale story as background to teach educational contents. I designed a static webpage using basic html/css/jquery. The fairy tale I used is "The Miraculous Journey of Edward Tulane". By introducing this story, i taught some knowledge about solid waste management. However, the contents are not well-connected to the story and paraphrased in order to serve target users.
